Hey Pierre,

Here's a little poem I thought you might enjoy:

The Real Estate Agent's Tale

In offices bright with screens aglow,
Where listings dance in rows below,
The agents hustle day and night,
To find that perfect site.

With phones in hand and keys galore,
They dash from door to door to door,
"Great potential!" is their cry,
"The perfect home to buy!"

Through open homes and auction days,
They guide their clients through the maze,
Of contracts, bids, and settlement dates,
While dreams and deals await.

In every suburb, rain or shine,
They're out there working all the time,
These matchmakers of brick and beam,
Helping people find their dream.

Hope this brings a smile to your day!

Best regards,
Chris
