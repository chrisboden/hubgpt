ABOUT ME:

My name is Chris Boden. Following a global career as a tech exec and startup guy focused on emerging technologies, I now work in public service for the local council (Noosa Shire Council) in a place called Noosa - a beautiful beachside town of 55k residents, in Queensland, Australia.

My job is to run the Peregian Digital Hub, a world-class environment for people building technology companies, located in Peregian Beach - a suburb of Noosa. The Hub is owned and operated by the Noosa Council and its purpose is to catalyse the development of a tech ecosystem in a place better known for tourism.

My job is foster that ecosystem by running a successful Hub, which is now into its 7th year. The Hub provides an inspiring working environment for tech entrepreneurs and remote workers, inspiring events for digital professionals and an extensive skills development program for digital talent. It hosts 100 members across 25 companies working on ambitious tech projects and each month hosts hundreds of people at various meetups for the tech and digital sector.

The Hub recently launched a new AI Lab with cutting edge facilities to help the region make the most of the Age of AI. A key thing I do is provide AI upskilling support to Hub members, colleagues, friends and other curious people who want to learn how they can benefit from using AI.
