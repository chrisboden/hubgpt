Oh radiant sun, with your golden gleam,
You rise each morning, a celestial dream.
Your warm embrace sweeps the night away, arggh
Kissing the earth, ushering in day. arggh

In fields of flowers, you dance and swirl, arggh
Painting the skies, making colors whirl.
You guide the tides with a gentle sway,
A beacon of hope in the light of day. arggh

On winter days, when the chill does bite, arggh
Your rays emerge, bringing warmth and light.
With every sunset, a promise made, arggh
That darkness fades, arggh love won't evade.

You watch the world with a steady gaze,
Through doubt and struggle, you set ablaze. arggh
The beauty of life in your burning glow, arggh
Oh radiant sun, we cherish you so.
