# Using Openrouter.ai as an LLM API

When building AI apps, my preference is to use a platform called OpenRouter which is a unified interface for LLMs. Rather than directly integrating with openai/anthropic/google etc, needing to get accounts and api keys with each of them, we instead use the openrouter service. Openrouter gives us a single api which uses the same python sdk/client as OpenAI (and other popular LLMs). The reason for giving you this guide is that your training data cutoff does not include the latest OpenAI API specs and instead includes deprecated api information. Use this instead as your guide.

This is README guide with examples for using OpenRouter with the OpenAI Python SDK, including instructions for handling tool calling (previously function calling), and different file types (for multimodality).

# **Quickstart for how to use the OpenAI python client with OpenRouter**

```python

from openai import OpenAI
import os

# gets API Key from my .env file for API_BASE_URL (which we use to override the openai url) and we set the OPENROUTER_API_KEY

client = OpenAI(
    base_url=os.getenv('API_BASE_URL'),
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful assistant"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
    }
  ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

## **Handling LLM responses: non-streamed vs streamed**

### **Non-streaming response structure:**

If the `stream` parameter is not set or is set to `false`, the non-streamed completion from the llm comes back in one accumulated response, in this format:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1677652288,
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "system_fingerprint": "fp_44709d6fcb",
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "\n\nHello there, how may I assist you today?",
    },
    "logprobs": null,
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 9,
    "completion_tokens": 12,
    "total_tokens": 21
  }
}
```

Handling non-streamed response structure:

```python
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say this is a test",
        },
    ],
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

### **Streaming response structure:**

If the `stream` parameter is set to `true` then the streamed completion returns in chunks and looks like this:

```json
{"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1694268190,"model":"gpt-4o-mini", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44709d6fcb", "choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":null}]}

{"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1694268190,"model":"gpt-4o-mini", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44709d6fcb", "choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"Hello"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":null}]}
```

Handling streamed response:

```python

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How do I output all files in a directory using Python?",
        },
    ],
    stream=True,
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice="auto"
)
for chunk in stream:
    if not chunk.choices:
        continue

    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
print()

```

Importantly, when dealing with streamed response, our code will need to accumulate chunks and parse the chunks for the tool call and arguments.


# **Using Tool Calls with OpenRouter**

### **Understanding Tool Calls**

**Tool Calls** let the LLM suggest tools to handle specific tasks by indicating:
1. **Suggested tool** and parameters.
2. **Developer invokes** the tool with the provided arguments.
3. **Tool results** are returned to the LLM.
4. The **LLM formats** a response using the tool's output.

### **Tool Call Process Overview**

1. **System message (optional) with User message and Available Tools**
2. **LLM replies with an Assistant message that has a content key with value of `null` and a tool_calls key with a value that is an array of tool calls with the tool's function name, eg `get_current_weather`, along with the arguments for the function and a tool_call_id**
3. **Our code should then use the tool call data to invoke the matching functions, which are python functions that get executed locally, eg the get_current_weather code may call out to a weather api to get current weather for a given city**
4. **Once our local function has executed, we need to send back a `Tool` message, ie a message with "role": "tool" and a "content" key with a value that includes the output of the tool we just executed. We also need to include the corresponding tool_call_id in that payload**
5. **The LLM then generates a final response for that tool flow, with an Assistant message**

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1. User Request with Available Tools**

An example of the five-turn sequence:

The user asks a question, while supplying a list of available tools in a JSON schema format:

```json

...
"messages": [{
  "role": "user",
  "content": "What is the weather like in Boston?"
}],
"tools": [{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "get_current_weather",
    "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "location": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
        },
        "unit": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": [
            "celsius",
            "fahrenheit"
          ]
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "location"
      ]
    }
  }
}],

```

### **2. The LLM responds with tool suggestion, together with appropriate arguments:**


```json

// Some models might include their reasoning in content
"message": {
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": null,
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "id": "call_9pw1qnYScqvGrCH58HWCvFH6",
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_current_weather",
        "arguments": "{ \"location\": \"Boston, MA\"}"
      }
    }
  ]
},


```

### **3. Developer Invokes the Tool Separately**

Use the provided tool arguments to call the tool, for example, a weather API:

```python
# Example function for weather data retrieval
def get_weather(location):
    return {"temperature": "22", "unit": "celsius", "description": "Sunny"}

# Invoke the tool based on LLM suggestion
weather_data = get_weather("Boston, MA")
```

### **4. Developer Provides Tool Results to LLM**

```json

...
"messages": [
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "What is the weather like in Boston?"
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": null,
    "tool_calls": [
      {
        "id": "call_9pw1qnYScqvGrCH58HWCvFH6",
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
          "name": "get_current_weather",
          "arguments": "{ \"location\": \"Boston, MA\"}"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "role": "tool",
    "name": "get_current_weather",
    "tool_call_id": "call_9pw1qnYScqvGrCH58HWCvFH6",
    "content": "{\"temperature\": \"22\", \"unit\": \"celsius\", \"description\": \"Sunny\"}"
  }
],

```

### **The LLM formats the tool result into a natural language response:**

```json
...
"message": {
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": "The current weather in Boston, MA is sunny with a temperature of 22Â°C."
}
```

---

### Important note:

That tool call flow uses the LLM as an intelligence step to:
1) take a user message and determine whether a tool call is needed in order to respond to it; 
2) decipher which tool, from the array of one or more tools available, should be selected for the job, and communicate this back to the client app, in the form of tool_calls - eg the get_current_weather tool); 
3) Figure out from the user message (or perhaps other messages in the previous message history) what arguments should be provided to the tool function (eg which city to get the weather for); 
4) Generate a final message in that tool call flow that answers the earlier user message.

In general, the Assistant message with tool_calls (and null content), is not exposed to the user in the UI and is handled behind the scenes. Similarly, the tool invocation and output from the tool is normally not shown to the user. That creates something of a magical effect when the LLM responds with the final Assistant message which answers the user's question in natural language but with accurate data.

Note that it is optional to send the tools message back to the LLM. We may have some flows where we are purely using the LLM to determine the tool calls and not needing it to provide the natural language response that uses the tool output data. In other words, our UX may invoke the tool locally and that tool may generate an output directly for the user rather than needing to have the LLM do that i an additional step. The step of sending the tool message back to the LLM is therefore optional.

In some agent workflows, accumulation of the tool call and tool response messages in the messages array, provides helpful context to subsequent steps. Eg if a tool provides a weather report and then subsequently another tool is used to create a graphic based on the weather, we may want to have those tool messages in the array as context for the image generation tool.



## **Advanced OpenRouter Usage**



### **Handling Images & Multimodal Requests**

OpenRouter supports sending images as either URLs or base64-encoded strings.

#### **Sending an Image URL**

```python
image_request = {
    "model": "mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
                {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"}}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
image_response = client.chat.completions.create(**image_request)
```

#### **Sending a Base64-Encoded Image**

```python
base64_image_request = {
    "type": "image_url",
    "image_url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD..."
}
base64_response = client.chat.completions.create(**base64_image_request)
```

Supported image formats: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`.

### **Stream Cancellation**

Use Pythonâs `signal` module for stream control and cancellation:

```python
import signal
import time

# Define a handler to cancel streaming
def timeout_handler(signum, frame):
    raise TimeoutError("Stream cancelled")

# Set timeout for 10 seconds
signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)
signal.alarm(10)  # 10 seconds

try:
    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="openai/got-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a long story"}],
        stream=True
    )
    for chunk in stream:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
except TimeoutError:
    print("Stream timed out and was cancelled.")
finally:
    signal.alarm(0)  # Disable alarm
```
